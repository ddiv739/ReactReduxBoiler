An easy react redux boiler in the form of a simple counter. Illustrates reducers, actions and is coupled up with react-promise for good measure. Bonus: css manipulation for component animation.

It's not fancy but hard and fast and works out of the box for many pet projects/simple applications which will save mucho woe. On the flip side, it doesnt suffer the bs of requiring any setup beyond the old npm install -> npm start.
